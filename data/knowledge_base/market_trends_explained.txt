Title: Understanding Market Trends

A market trend refers to the general direction in which prices move over a period of time. Trends can be upward, downward, or sideways.

Trend lines are visual tools used in charts to show how prices change over time. They help investors understand historical price movements.

Market trends do not predict future performance. External factors such as economic conditions, interest rates, and global events influence market behavior.

Trend analysis is an educational tool and should not be considered financial advice.
