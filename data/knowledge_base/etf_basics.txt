Title: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) – Basics

An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment fund that holds a collection of assets such as stocks, bonds, or commodities. ETFs are traded on stock exchanges, similar to individual stocks.

ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to many assets at once, which helps with diversification. For example, a single ETF may track an index like the S&P 500, giving the investor exposure to hundreds of companies.

Unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices. Most ETFs have lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds.

ETFs do not guarantee profits and can lose value depending on market conditions. Past performance does not predict future results.
