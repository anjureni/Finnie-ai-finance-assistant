Title: Stocks vs Bonds – Key Differences

Stocks represent ownership in a company. When an investor buys a stock, they become a shareholder and may benefit from company growth and dividends.

Bonds are debt instruments. When an investor buys a bond, they are lending money to a government or company in exchange for interest payments.

Stocks generally offer higher potential returns but come with higher risk. Bonds are typically more stable but provide lower returns.

A balanced portfolio often includes both stocks and bonds to manage risk and return.
