Title: Investment Diversification – Educational Overview

Diversification is an investment strategy that involves spreading money across different asset types, industries, or geographic regions to reduce risk.

The goal of diversification is to avoid having too much exposure to a single investment. If one asset performs poorly, other investments may help offset losses.

Common asset classes include stocks, bonds, cash, and real assets. A diversified portfolio often includes a mix of these asset classes.

Diversification does not eliminate risk entirely, but it can help reduce volatility and improve long-term stability.
